NOTE: You may need a Admin mod such as ULX or Evolve to issue these commands as GMod DayZ does not come with an built in admin mod.

These commands work in your in-game console, not the servers.

Commands prefixed with * are Super-Admin only.

Commands that also work in the server console are prefixed with ^.

NOTE: Player names are searched, so you can supply part of or all of a name.

Setup Commmands:

*dz_setinitialspawn - Sets the initial player spawn-point (where players spawn before they load/create character, a safe place)
*dz_setszteleportpos - Sets the safezone teleport position. Used if teleporting is enabled, or the player is brand new (spawn in safezone)
