It's a non-official re-upload of the closed DayZ v 6.66.
Since the dev is not fixing anything i'm here to do that.
A bug? glitch? need help to setup? --> Maxime_48#3571

All instruction for the install are there, if you can't understand i suggest using google translate

For mentioned pages that are not available don not hesitate to use the wayback machine
The mentioned workshop ressource is not available but making a ressource addon from the ressources there should work the same, any pull request for this is welcome.
